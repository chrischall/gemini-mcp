MCP server for Google Gemini image generation and editing. Exposes four tools to Claude over stdio: list available models, generate images from text prompts, edit or compose images with text instructions, and generate a consistent set of images from a master prompt. Images are written to disk by default (path returned) or returned inline as base64. Built on the Gemini v1beta API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) using the Nano Banana / Nano Banana Pro model family.

Developed and maintained by AI (Claude Code).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Google Gemini API key ([aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)) |
| `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` | No | Override the default image model (default: `gemini-3.1-flash-image`) |
| `GEMINI_OUTPUT_DIR` | No | Default directory for generated images (default: current working directory) |
| `GEMINI_INPUT_DIR` | No | Directory to resolve bare input-image filenames against (so `images: ["foo.jpg"]` works) |
| `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Upstream request timeout in ms (default: `60000`, or `120000` for `image_size: "4K"`); each generation tool also takes a per-call `timeout_ms` |
| `GEMINI_HEARTBEAT_MS` | No | Progress-notification cadence in ms while a generation runs (default: `10000`; `0` disables) — keeps MCP hosts that reset their timeout on progress from timing out long generations |

### Long generations and client timeouts

4K / Pro-model generations can outrun an MCP host's own `tools/call` timeout (error `-32001`).
The server sends `notifications/progress` heartbeats so hosts that reset their timeout on
progress wait it out. If the host still gives up, the server-side generation usually completes
anyway: the image is written to the output dir, `gemini_interact` also writes an
`<image>.json` sidecar recording the `interaction_id`, and `continue_last: true` resumes the
interaction the lost response belonged to — check the output dir before re-issuing a call
(a re-issue is a second billable generation).

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gemini_list_models` | List available Gemini image models and the current default |
| `gemini_generate_image` | Generate image(s) from a text prompt |
| `gemini_edit_image` | One-off edits or multi-image composition with a text instruction (for a series of edits, use `gemini_interact`) |
| `gemini_generate_set` | Generate a master image plus N consistent images referencing it |
| `gemini_interact` | Preferred tool for iterative refinement: multi-turn generation/editing via the Interactions API — chain the returned `interaction_id` via `previous_interaction_id` (or `continue_last: true`) |
